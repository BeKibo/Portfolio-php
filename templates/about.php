            Hi ,there
        </h1>
        
        <p class= "">
            I'm a designer currently transitioning into full-stack web development. As a junior developer, I bring a fresh perspective and a strong motivation to grow. I already feel comfortable working with design tools like Figma and the Adobe Suite, and I’m actively building my skills in technologies like HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. My design background gives me an eye for detail and user experience that I carry into every project.
            <br><br>
            I’m passionate about art in all its forms, video games, and anything that brings creativity and technology together. I enjoy crafting digital experiences that are not only functional but also visually engaging.
            <br><br>
            My goal is to blend my design sensibility with my development journey to create projects that are thoughtful, user-centered, and beautifully executed.
